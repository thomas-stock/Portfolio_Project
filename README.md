I have included several projects that I have worked on throughout my undergraduate studies and on my own time. 
These projects are programmed with Python as well as some R for solving problems with open data sets or general modeling.
Several projects have used machine learning and statistics to evaluate problems in marketing, ecology, finance, etc.
